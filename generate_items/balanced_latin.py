def balanced_latin(condNum):
    """
    Generate a **balanced** Latin square based on the given condition number.
    Balanced Latin square is different from generic Latin square. 
    It removes the immediate carry-over effects: A condition will precede another condition exactly once.
    In generic Latin square, the precedence is order is always the same,
    given A, B, C, conditions B is preceded by A, C by B, and A by C.

    Args:
        condNum (int): The number of conditions.

    Returns:
        list: 
            A list representing the balanced Latin square. Given that you have a .csv file, 
            where every line represent one and only condition of an item, 
            and the order of conditions are the same in every item set, 
            you can bind this list as a new column title "Group" to your .csv file. 
            PCIbex will create the grouping.
            Do not forget to repeat the final list by (Number of Items/Number of Conditions) 
            before binding it to the .csv file.
