# Experiment

Given previous discussion about @LauLiao2018 and following work,
the semantic contribution of the items is need to be discussed.
Even though there are multitude of theoretical discussions on the nature of bare plurals in English,
there is no clear agreement on the nature of their mental or behavioral representations.

The present study tested
people's a priori tendency to complete sentence fragments that starts with bare plurals
in an experimental environment where there is no preceding context.
In addition to their base tendency, the present study aimed to test
how adjectival modification, coordination, or definite marking affects their base tendency.

To this end, we use a sentence completion task with no forced choice.
Participants are asked to provide an appropriate following to sentence fragments
that consist of bare plurals, definite plurals, their modified and/or coordinated forms,
as well as various different structures as fillers,
such as wh-phrases, if clauses, proper names, and adjuncts.

## Methods

The experiment consisted of two parts,
the first part is the preamble completion part.
Participants were provided a sentence fragment and
were asked to provide an appropriate completion.
In the second part of the experiment,
participants were asked to judge sentences using a Likert scale(1-5).
The main rationale behind including a judgment task
was to make participants be more aware of their completions.

#### Completion Task

The first part of the experiment compromised 2 x 2 x 2 design
(structure: coordination/list x determiner: bare/definite x modification: modified/not-modified).
In total, 4 trials were presented in each of the 8 conditions.
Half of the trials contained two noun phrases both of which sharing the same structure.
The other half of the experimental trials contained a single noun phrase.
All experimental items consisted plural nouns.
Example experimental item (\ref{exp-item}) shows the modified coordinated definite plural condition,
and @tbl-conds shows all manipulations.

: All experimental conditions. {#tbl-conds}


Noun phrases and adjectives were selected from the original study by @LauLiao2018.
Noun phrases were selected randomly,
and the same adjectives from the original study was used for those noun phrases.
Similarly, the coordinands were also kept constant between this study and the original study by @LauLiao2018.

To preclude participants from limiting themselves to a small set of context,
we included 64 filler sentences.
Fillers consisted of structures that are different from the experimental items.
They can be categorized into 9 different groups as shown in @tbl-fillers.



| Filler Type             | Example                                                  |       Count |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Relative Clause         | The book that kept me up all night                       |          10 |
| Proper Names            | The dynamic duo of Lucy and Max                          |          10 |
| Adjuncts                | During a starry summer night                             |          10 |
| Wh-phrases              | What to do after                                         |          10 |
| Quantified NPs          | Most challenges                                          |           5 |
| Modified Quantified NPs | Few precious chances, which had eluded them for so long, |           5 |
| Conditionals            | If the world was ruled by cats,                          |           6 |
| Inverted Conditionals   | Were I to open a bakery shop,                            |           4 |
| Correlatives            | Wherever the party was                                   |           4 |
|                         |                                                          | *Total*: 64 |

: All filler types, examples, and counts. {#tbl-fillers}

Within the whole experiment,
the number of preambles that may serve as a plural head was 0.53% of the total items.

#### Judgment Task

The second part of the experiment consisted two types of sentences:
(i) completed versions of the sentences in the first part and
(ii) sentences from @FrazierEtAl2007 study.
Sentences from the first part of the experiment was acquired through a pilot study
carried out voluntarily by University of Maryland graduate students.
We selected 22 filler sentences and 32 experimental sentences from the pilot study,
covering all experimental conditions (except definite ones) and filler types.
From @FrazierEtAl2007 study, we included 20 items using only two conditions from the experiment,
which used bare plurals in the subject positions.
We manipulated whether the first sentence is an episodic (\ref{f-item-a}) or a generic sentence (\ref{f-item-c}).

### Procedure

#### Completion Task

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform [@Drummond2013;@ZehrSchwarz2018].
Each participant session took approximately 25 minutes.
Participants provided demographic information and
gave informed consent to participate in the experiment.
A practice and instructions sessions preceded the experiment,
in which participants were provided with a set of sentence fragments.
Instruction sections included a comprehension question to
confirm that they understood the task.
This section also included
two trials with bare plural noun phrases as sentence fragments,
after they were probed to complete them,
they were also provided other possible completions
which featured both existential and generic examples.
In this section, they were told to not repeat themselves while completing sentences and
provide vivid completions.
They were also instructed about the character (15) and time limit (25 seconds).
In the practice section, they were asked to complete 7 sentence fragments.

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen,
and followed by a full sentence presentation in the center of the screen
that stayed in the screen for 25 seconds.
In this time period, they were expected to write the sentence completiong and
press \texttt{\textsc{enter}} key.
During the practice item,
a warning message in red font appeared if they did not respond within 25 seconds or
write more than 15 characters, including whitespaces.
Sentence fragments and instructions were presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a white background.

Items were randomly paired into 8 different lists
according to a balanced Latin-square design [@Bradley1958].
Balanced Latin-square made sure that
each item would appear in either one of the condition and
not any other for a participant.
It also removes the immediate carry-over effects:
A condition will precede another condition exactly once.
The items in these lists were shuffled as well.

#### Judgment Task

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform [@Drummond2013;@ZehrSchwarz2018].
Each participant session took approximately 25 minutes.
Participants were directed from the previous task,
and greeted by a welcome screen.
Following the initial screen, the instruction and the practice screen were presented,
in which participants judge **10?** sentences.
In the instructions screen,
participants were told to judge sentences as fast and accurately as possible.
They were also instructed about time limit (25 seconds).

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen,
and followed by a asterisk in the middle of the screen as a fixation point,
that stayed in the screen for 500 ms
and presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a white background.

Following blank screen and fixation point,
the full sentence was presented in the center of the screen
and stayed on the screen for 25 seconds.
In this time period, they were expected to read the sentence and
judge it using the Likert (1-7) scale presented in the screen.
During the practice item,
a warning message in red font appeared if they did not respond within 25 seconds.
Sentences and instructions were presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a white background.

### Participants

A total of 40 participants will be recruited through Prolific.
They will be paid **5?** US dollars.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
All participants are intented to be English native speakers from United States, and
participants that are not native English speakers will be excluded.
Participants who answered the comprehension question in the instructions wrongly
will be excluded as well.
In order to detect bots, we included a dialect recognition task following @Maher2023,
in which participants will listen an audio recording and select the dialect used in the audio.
Participants that failed to correctly recognize the dialect task will be exclude, since they will be treated as bots.
Participants that complete sentence in an inappropriate or repeating way,
such as completions in the same manner all the time or completions as random strings, will also be excluded.



<!-- :::{.callout-important}
## To-dos

experiment:

- include "you will not have any money if you do this and this."
- include zach's task or counting task.
- maybe include in the instructions that there are some special tasks
- when a task start with "!!!" give only the correct answer.
