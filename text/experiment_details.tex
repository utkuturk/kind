\section{Experiment}\label{experiment}}

Given previous discussion about Lau and Liao
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-LauLiao2018}{2018}) and following
work,\footnote{mainly discuss how syntactic structure might not be the main thing.}
the semantic contribution of the items is need to be discussed. Even
though there are multitude of theoretical discussions on the nature of
bare plurals in English, there is no clear agreement on the nature of
their mental or behavioral representations.

The present study tested people's a priori tendency to complete sentence
fragments that starts with bare plurals in an experimental environment
where there is no preceding context. In addition to their base tendency,
the present study aimed to test how adjectival modification,
coordination, or definite marking affects their base tendency.

To this end, we use a sentence completion task with no forced choice.
Participants are asked to provide an appropriate following to sentence
fragments that consist of bare plurals, definite plurals, their modified
and/or coordinated forms, as well as various different structures as
fillers, such as wh-phrases, if clauses, proper names, and adjuncts.
\#\# Methods

The experiment consisted of two parts, the first part is the preamble
completion part. Participants were provided a sentence fragment and were
asked to provide an appropriate completion. In the second part of the
experiment, participants were asked to judge sentences using a Likert
scale(1-5). The main rationale behind including a judgment task was to
make participants be more aware of their completions.

\paragraph{Completion Task}\label{completion-task}}

The first part of the experiment compromised 2 x 2 x 2 design
(structure: coordination/list x determiner: bare/definite x
modification: modified/not-modified). In total, 4 trials were presented
in each of the 8 conditions. Half of the trials contained two noun
phrases both of which sharing the same structure. The other half of the
experimental trials contained a single noun phrase. All experimental
items consisted plural nouns. Example experimental item (\ref{exp-item})
shows the modified coordinated definite plural condition, and
Table~\ref{tbl-conds} shows all manipulations.

Noun phrases and adjectives were selected from the original study by Lau
and Liao (\protect\hyperlink{ref-LauLiao2018}{2018}). Noun phrases were
selected randomly, and the same adjectives from the original study was
used for those noun phrases. Similarly, the coordinands were also kept
constant between this study and the original study by Lau and Liao
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-LauLiao2018}{2018}).

To preclude participants from limiting themselves to a small set of
context, we included 64 filler sentences. Fillers consisted of
structures that are different from the experimental items. They can be
categorized into 9 different groups as shown in Table~\ref{tbl-fillers}.

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Drummond2013}{Drummond 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ZehrSchwarz2018}{Zehr and Schwarz 2018}). Each
participant session took approximately 25 minutes. Participants provided
demographic information and gave informed consent to participate in the
experiment. A practice and instrucstions sessions preceded the
experiment, in which participants were provided with a set of sentence
fragments. Instruction sections included two trials with bare plural
noun phrases as sentence fragments, after they were probed to complete
them, they were also provided other possible completions which featured
both existential and generic examples. In this section, they were told
to not repeat themselves while completing sentences and provide vivid
completions. They were also instructed about the character (15) and time
limit (25 seconds). In the practice section, they were asked to complete
\textbf{10?} sentence fragments.

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen, and followed by a full
sentence presentation in the center of the screen that stayed in the
screen for 25 seconds. In this time period, they were expected to write
the sentence completiong and press \texttt{\textsc{enter}} key. During
the practice item, a warning message in red font appeared if they did
not respond within 25 seconds or write more than 15 characters,
including whitespaces. Sentence fragments and instructions were
presented in black \textbf{24?}-point case Helvetica font on a white
background.

Items were randomly paired into 8 different lists according to a
balanced Latin-square design
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bradley1958}{Bradley 1958}). Balanced
Latin-square made sure that each item would appear in either one of the
condition and not any other for a participant. It also removes the
immediate carry-over effects: A condition will precede another condition
exactly once. The items in these lists were shuffled as well.

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Drummond2013}{Drummond 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ZehrSchwarz2018}{Zehr and Schwarz 2018}). Each
participant session took approximately 25 minutes. Participants were
directed from the previous task, and greeted by a welcome screen.
Following the initial screen, the instruction and the practice screen
were presented, in which participants judge \textbf{10?} sentences. In
the instructions screen, participants were told to not judge sentences
as fast and accurately as possible. They were also instructed about time
limit (25 seconds).

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen, and followed by a full
sentencen presentation in the center of the screen that stayed in the
screen for 25 seconds. In this time period, they were expected to read
the sentence and press judge using the Likert scale presented in the
screen. During the practice item, a warning message in red font appeared
if they did not respond within 25 seconds. Sentences and instructions
were presented in black \textbf{24?}-point case Helvetica font on a
white background.
