\section{Experiment}\label{experiment}}

Given previous discussion about \textcite{LauLiao2018} and following
work, the semantic contribution of the items is need to be discussed.
Even though there are multitude of theoretical discussions on the nature
of bare plurals in English, there is no clear agreement on the nature of
their mental or behavioral representations.

The present study tested people's a priori tendency to complete sentence
fragments that starts with bare plurals in an experimental environment
where there is no preceding context. In addition to their base tendency,
the present study aimed to test how adjectival modification,
coordination, or definite marking affects their base tendency.

To this end, we use a sentence completion task with no forced choice.
Participants are asked to provide an appropriate following to sentence
fragments that consist of bare plurals, definite plurals, their modified
and/or coordinated forms, as well as various different structures as
fillers, such as wh-phrases, if clauses, proper names, and adjuncts.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

The experiment consisted of two parts, the first part is the preamble
completion part. Participants were provided a sentence fragment and were
asked to provide an appropriate completion. In the second part of the
experiment, participants were asked to judge sentences using a Likert
scale(1-5). The main rationale behind including a judgment task was to
make participants be more aware of their completions.

\paragraph{Completion Task}\label{completion-task}}

The first part of the experiment compromised 2 x 2 x 2 design
(structure: coordination/list x determiner: bare/definite x
modification: modified/not-modified). In total, 4 trials were presented
in each of the 8 conditions. Half of the trials contained two noun
phrases both of which sharing the same structure. The other half of the
experimental trials contained a single noun phrase. All experimental
items consisted plural nouns. Example experimental item (\ref{exp-item})
shows the modified coordinated definite plural condition, and
Table~\ref{tbl-conds} shows all manipulations.

Noun phrases and adjectives were selected from the original study by
\textcite{LauLiao2018}. Noun phrases were selected randomly, and the
same adjectives from the original study was used for those noun phrases.
Similarly, the coordinands were also kept constant between this study
and the original study by \textcite{LauLiao2018}.

To preclude participants from limiting themselves to a small set of
context, we included 64 filler sentences. Fillers consisted of
structures that are different from the experimental items. They can be
categorized into 9 different groups as shown in Table~\ref{tbl-fillers}.

Within the whole experiment, the number of preambles that may serve as a
plural head was 0.53\% of the total items.

\hypertarget{judgment-task}{%
\paragraph{Judgment Task}\label{judgment-task}}

The second part of the experiment consisted two types of sentences: (i)
completed versions of the sentences in the first part and (ii) sentences
from \textcite{FrazierEtAl2007} study. Sentences from the first part of
the experiment was acquired through a pilot study carried out
voluntarily by University of Maryland graduate students. We selected 22
filler sentences and 32 experimental sentences from the pilot study,
covering all experimental conditions (except definite ones) and filler
types. From \textcite{FrazierEtAl2007} study, we included 20 items using
only two conditions from the experiment, which used bare plurals in the
subject positions. We manipulated whether the first sentence is an
episodic (\ref{f-item-a}) or a generic sentence (\ref{f-item-c}).

\paragraph{Completion Task}\label{completion-task-1}}

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform
\autocite{Drummond2013,ZehrSchwarz2018}. Each participant session took
approximately 25 minutes. Participants provided demographic information
and gave informed consent to participate in the experiment. A practice
and instructions sessions preceded the experiment, in which participants
were provided with a set of sentence fragments. Instruction sections
included a comprehension question to confirm that they understood the
task. This section also included two trials with bare plural noun
phrases as sentence fragments, after they were probed to complete them,
they were also provided other possible completions which featured both
existential and generic examples. In this section, they were told to not
repeat themselves while completing sentences and provide vivid
completions. They were also instructed about the character (15) and time
limit (25 seconds). In the practice section, they were asked to complete
7 sentence fragments.

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen, and followed by a full
sentence presentation in the center of the screen that stayed in the
screen for 25 seconds. In this time period, they were expected to write
the sentence completiong and press \texttt{\textsc{enter}} key. During
the practice item, a warning message in red font appeared if they did
not respond within 25 seconds or write more than 15 characters,
including whitespaces. Sentence fragments and instructions were
presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a white background.

Items were randomly paired into 8 different lists according to a
balanced Latin-square design \autocite{Bradley1958}. Balanced
Latin-square made sure that each item would appear in either one of the
condition and not any other for a participant. It also removes the
immediate carry-over effects: A condition will precede another condition
exactly once. The items in these lists were shuffled as well.

\hypertarget{judgment-task-1}{%
\paragraph{Judgment Task}\label{judgment-task-1}}

The experiment was run online in PCIbex platform
\autocite{Drummond2013,ZehrSchwarz2018}. Each participant session took
approximately 25 minutes. Participants were directed from the previous
task, and greeted by a welcome screen. Following the initial screen, the
instruction and the practice screen were presented, in which
participants judge \textbf{10?} sentences. In the instructions screen,
participants were told to judge sentences as fast and accurately as
possible. They were also instructed about time limit (25 seconds).

Each trial began with 200 ms blank screen, and followed by a asterisk in
the middle of the screen as a fixation point, that stayed in the screen
for 500 ms and presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a
white background.

Following blank screen and fixation point, the full sentence was
presented in the center of the screen and stayed on the screen for 25
seconds. In this time period, they were expected to read the sentence
and judge it using the Likert (1-7) scale presented in the screen.
During the practice item, a warning message in red font appeared if they
did not respond within 25 seconds. Sentences and instructions were
presented in black 16-point case Helvetica font on a white background.

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

A total of 40 participants will be recruited through Prolific. They will
be paid \textbf{5?} US dollars. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants. All participants are intented to be English
native speakers from United States, and participants that are not native
English speakers will be excluded. Participants who answered the
comprehension question in the instructions wrongly will be excluded as
well. In order to detect bots, we included a dialect recognition task
following \textcite{Maher2023}, in which participants will listen an
audio recording and select the dialect used in the audio. Participants
that failed to correctly recognize the dialect task will be exclude,
since they will be treated as bots. Participants that complete sentence
in an inappropriate or repeating way, such as completions in the same
manner all the time or completions as random strings, will also be
excluded.
